Collections
===========

Nearly every program requires collections:
Arrays, vectors, maps, queues, lists, stacks.

Slices
------

The basic array type in D is called a slice.
In C an array is just syntactic sugar for a pointer,
which means that length checks must be handled by the user.
Higher-level languages like Java provide an referenced data structure,
which necessarily means a double indirection.
D slices are in between.
They know their size,
so boundary checks are implicit.
However,
they are low-level to be fast.
This means they might have some unexpected behavior.
I strongly advice to read
`this article <http://dlang.org/d-array-article.html>`_,
which covers everything you need to know about slices.
Proper container classes are build on top of slices.

Std.container
-------------

The standard library provides `std.container <http://dlang.org/phobos/std_container.html>`_,
which provides a few generic containers.

More
----

Everybody agrees that currently the standard library should provide more collection types.
However, the community wants to have the allocator design finished,
before collections are designed,
because allocation is a important part within collections.
Nevertheless, if you need more right now,
there are a few options.
