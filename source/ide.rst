IDE
===

For vim and emacs users this is not an interesting point,
but many programmers want solid IDE support.

For MS Visual Studio,
there is `VisualD <http://www.dsource.org/projects/visuald>`_.
This project is officially endorsed,
as `its code <https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/visuald>`_
is hosted within the `D Github group <https://github.com/D-Programming-Language>`_.

There are also plugins for
`Eclipse <https://code.google.com/p/ddt/>`_
and `MonoDevelop <http://mono-d.alexanderbothe.com/>`_.
